# Markdown Agent Studio

A visual IDE for building, orchestrating, and observing autonomous AI agent teams.

Define agents in markdown. Watch them collaborate in real time.

## What It Does

**Agent Definition in Markdown** -- Define autonomous AI agents using markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Each agent gets a role, tools, and instructions -- no boilerplate, no frameworks.

**Real-Time Graph Visualization** -- Watch your agent team come alive on an interactive node graph. See who's talking to whom, track tool calls, and follow the flow of work as it happens.

**Built-In Inspector** -- Drill into any agent's chat log, event history, and memory state. Full visibility into what each agent is thinking and doing.

**Zero-Cost Demo Mode** -- Experience a full 6-agent website-building team with pre-scripted conversations -- no API key required. See the platform in action before connecting your own AI provider.

git clone <repo-url>
cd markdown-agent-studio
